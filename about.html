      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>Ruby Pictures was founded in 2023 by a group of passionate photographers who shared a vision to <b>make professional photography accessible to everyone</b>, regardless of their financial background or social status.</p>
      <p>The idea was sparked when our founder, <b>Ruby Dlamini</b>, noticed a growing gap in the photography industry. High-quality photography was often viewed as a luxury, leaving many without the opportunity to capture their most important milestones. Ruby set out to change that.</p>
      <p>From a small home studio in <b>Johannesburg</b>, Ruby Pictures evolved into a <b>community-focused</b> photography business. We built our reputation on <b>inclusivity, affordability, and creativity</b>, offering personalized packages for intimate family shoots, graduations, weddings, and corporate events.</p>
      <p>At Ruby Pictures, we believe <b>every story deserves to be told beautifully</b>. Our team takes pride in working with people from all walks of life, ensuring every client feels comfortable and confident in front of the camera. Today, Ruby Pictures is a movement to democratize photography.</p>
      <p><b>Core Values:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Affordability</li>
        <li>Inclusivity</li>
        <li>Creativity</li>
      </ul>
